As you can see its been a big problem, i can always rejoin but the likelihood ill get booted is HIGH. It happens sometimes when i'm playing alone on the server, but not nearly as often as it happens when i'm close too someone else in game, and its even worse when i'm close too the server host, which is SUPER WEIRD. PLEASE HELP. it happens in all sorts of other friend hosted servers too, the versions have been difforent then but all these apply too the modded fabric version 1.21, i have all my mods in the mod folder instad of cursed forge but I doubt thats an issue.
